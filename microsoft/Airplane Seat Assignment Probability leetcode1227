class Solution {

    {
        if(n==1) return 1;
        return 0.5;
    }
}
//reason that the code is small and question rating is medium because of question is asking about the probability of nth person finding his seat 
//since n number of seats available he will always attain his seat ..if its only one he can take his seat for more than or equal to two the probability is always 1/2.
//1/2 is represented as 0.5
